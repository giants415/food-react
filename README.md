# Recipe Finder

[Check out the project](https://recipe-finder-1801.herokuapp.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Purpose
Choosing recipes can be difficult and sometimes choices are limited; recipe finder solves this issue by suggesting a recipe when a user first visits and also allows users to search for a recipe based upon a single ingredient.

## Recipe Finder utilizes
* [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/)
* React
* Redux
* React DOM
* React Router
* Redux Form
* Redux Promise
* Axios
* Lodash
* HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (ES6)


## Future Development Ideas
* Add search capability for food categories and locale
* Additional styling
* Refactor styling code out of components and into single style sheet
